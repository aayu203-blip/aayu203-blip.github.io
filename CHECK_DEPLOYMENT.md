# Check Your Deployment

The URL `aayu203-blip-github-io.vercel.app` might be pointing to your MAIN site, not the weaver-game.

## Check in Vercel Dashboard:

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Look for a project called `aayu203-blip-github-io` OR `weaver-game`
3. Click on the weaver-game project
4. Check the deployment URL - it should be something like:
   - `weaver-game-xxxxx.vercel.app`
   - OR `aayu203-blip-github-io-xxxxx.vercel.app`

## Make sure you're using the RIGHT project URL:

The weaver-game should be a SEPARATE project in Vercel with its own URL. Don't use the main site's URL.

Check the Vercel dashboard to find the correct weaver-game deployment URL!
