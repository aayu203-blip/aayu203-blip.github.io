# 🎯 CLEAN URL STRATEGY OPTIONS

## Current Situation
**Physical Files:** `pages/products/scania/hydraulic-systems-&-connectors/302624.html`
**Current URLs:** `https://partstrading.com/pages/products/scania/hydraulic-systems-&-connectors/302624.html`

❌ TOO LONG!
❌ "pages" and "products" add no value
❌ Harder for users to remember
❌ Not SEO-optimal

---

## 🌟 OPTION 1: Brand/Category/Part (RECOMMENDED)

### URL Format:
```
https://partstrading.com/{brand}/{category}/{part}
```

### Examples:
```
✅ https://partstrading.com/scania/hydraulic-systems/302624
✅ https://partstrading.com/volvo/engine-components/21063612

```

### Pros:
- ✅ Clean and professional

- ✅ Easy to read and remember
- ✅ Makes sense to users
- ✅ Industry standard

### Cons:
- ⚠️ Requires URL rewriting in Vercel
- ⚠️ Need to update all 2,497 pages

### Implementation:
Keep files where they are, use Vercel rewrites:

{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/:brand/:category/:part",
      "destination": "/pages/products/:brand/:category/:part.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🌟 OPTION 2: Just Part Number (SIMPLE)

https://partstrading.com/parts/{part-number}
```

### Examples:
```
✅ https://partstrading.com/parts/302624

## 🌟 OPTION 3: Brand + Part (COMPROMISE)

✅ https://partstrading.com/komatsu/12345
```

## 🎯 SIMPLIFIED CATEGORY NAMES

Also clean up category names in URLs:

| `braking-system-components` | `braking` |
| `engine-components` | `engine` |
