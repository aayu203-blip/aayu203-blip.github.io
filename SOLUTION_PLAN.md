# ðŸ”§ SOLUTION PLAN FOR CRITICAL ISSUES

## PROBLEM 1: Redirect Page on Search
**Root Cause:** Vercel rewrites don't cover all file paths
**Solution:** Use simpler, catch-all rewrite pattern OR just use actual file paths

## PROBLEM 2: Category Pages Show "0 of 0 parts"
**Root Cause:** Line 522 - Empty existingProductPages Set filters out everything
**Line 518:** Complex regex filter is too restrictive
**Solution:** Remove the existingProductPages filter, simplify regex

## RECOMMENDED FIX:

Option A: REVERT to actual file URLs (SAFEST)
- Stop using clean URLs for now
- Use actual file paths: /pages/products/volvo/engine-components/12345.html
- Everything will work immediately
- Can implement clean URLs later with proper testing

Option B: FIX Vercel rewrites + Category pages (COMPLEX)
- Create comprehensive Vercel rewrites
- Fix all category page filters
- Risk of more issues

## MY RECOMMENDATION: OPTION A (Revert)
Let's use the ACTUAL file paths that are guaranteed to work.
Clean URLs can be added later as an enhancement with proper testing.
