# QUIRKY Knot - Animation Comparison

This page has been deployed to your website at:

**https://partstrading.com/quirky-knot/**

## Features

- Two animation styles:
  - **Single-letter reveal**: Letters stop one at a time sequentially
  - **Continuous stop reveal**: All letters spin, then stop one-by-one
- Adjustable animation speed slider
- Reduced motion support for accessibility
- Built with React, Framer Motion, and Tailwind CSS (all via CDN)

## How It Works

The page uses:
- React 18 (via CDN)
- Framer Motion 11 (via CDN)

- Babel Standalone (for JSX transformation)

All dependencies are loaded from CDN, so no build step is required.
