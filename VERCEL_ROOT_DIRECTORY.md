# How to Set Root Directory in Vercel

## If "weaver-game" isn't in the dropdown list:

**Just type it manually!**

1. Click on the "Root Directory" field (where it shows `./`)
2. **Delete** the `./` 
3. **Type**: `weaver-game`
4. Press Enter or click outside the field

Vercel will accept it even if it's not in the dropdown. The dropdown is just a suggestion - you can type any path that exists in your repository.

## Verify it worked:

After typing `weaver-game`, you should see:
- Framework Preset auto-detects as "Next.js"
- The path shows: `weaver-game`

## Continue with deployment:

Then add the environment variable and click Deploy!
