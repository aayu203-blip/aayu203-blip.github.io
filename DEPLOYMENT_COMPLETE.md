# ✅ Deployment Configuration Complete!

## What I've Done:

1. ✅ **Added weaver-game to repository** - All code is in `weaver-game/` directory
2. ✅ **Configured vercel.json** - Set up routing for `/weaver` path
3. ✅ **Pushed to GitHub** - Code is live in the repository
4. ✅ **Created build configuration** - Vercel will auto-detect Next.js

## ⚠️ One Final Step Required:

Since environment variables can't be set via files (security), you need to add it in Vercel Dashboard:

### Quick Setup (2 minutes):

1. **Go to**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Find your project** (should be `aayu203-blip.github.io` or connected to `partstrading.com`)
3. **Click on the project** → **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. **Add New Variable**:
   - **Key**: `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: `AIzaSyBBb94IbmgKmnRG6FJRcTlnfP2NQZrnMU0`
   - **Environments**: ✅ Production ✅ Preview ✅ Development
5. **Click Save**
6. **Redeploy** (or wait for auto-deploy from the git push)

### Alternative: Use Vercel CLI

If you have Vercel CLI installed:
```bash
cd aayu203-blip.github.io
vercel env add GEMINI_API_KEY
# Paste: AIzaSyBBb94IbmgKmnRG6FJRcTlnfP2NQZrnMU0
# Select: Production, Preview, Development
```

## After Environment Variable is Set:

Vercel will automatically:
- Detect the Next.js app in `weaver-game/`
- Build it with the configured settings
- Deploy it to `partstrading.com/weaver`

## Test It:

Once deployed, visit: **https://partstrading.com/weaver**

**Everything else is configured and ready!** Just need that one environment variable set in Vercel dashboard. 🚀
