# 🔍 INTERNAL LINKS AUDIT & FIX PLAN

## 🚨 ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Issue 1: Internal Links Still Use Old URLs
All internal links across the site need updating to new clean format:
- Search database results
- Product category pages
- Related product links
- Blog links
- Breadcrumbs
- "All products" links

### Issue 2: Homepage Category Cards - Broken Navigation
When clicking a category card and selecting a brand, it should go directly to that brand's category page, not ask to select category again.

### Issue 3: Broken Category Pages
Some category pages are broken/empty:
- ❌ /pages/categories/volvo-hydraulic-systems-and-connectors.html (broken)
- ✅ /pages/categories/volvo-lighting-and-exterior-body-components.html (working)
- ❌ /pages/categories/scania-hydraulic-systems-and-connectors.html (empty)
