# Google Indexing Issue - RESOLVED
## Date: October 27, 2025
## Issue: Volvo/Scania Pages "Crawled - Currently Not Indexed"

---

## 🎯 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

Google Search Console showed hundreds of pages as **"Crawled - currently not indexed"**:

### Two Types of Pages:

#### 1. ✅ Multilingual Pages (Expected Behavior)
These **should NOT be indexed** - working correctly:
- `/ta/` (Tamil)
- `/ar/` (Arabic)  
- `/te/` (Telugu)
- `/ml/` (Malayalam)
- `/ru/` (Russian)
- `/kn/` (Kannada)
- `/es/` (Spanish)
- `/id/` (Indonesian)
- `/fr/` (French)
- `/cn/` (Chinese)
- `/hi/` (Hindi)

**Why:** These pages have canonical tags pointing to English versions, preventing duplicate content issues. This is **correct SEO practice**.

---

#### 2. ⚠️ Volvo/Scania Product Pages (PROBLEM - NOW FIXED)
These **should be indexed** but weren't:
- `/volvo/engine/*.html`
- `/volvo/braking/*.html`
- `/volvo/suspension/*.html`
- `/scania/hydraulics/*.html`
- `/scania/engine/*.html`
- `/scania/suspension/*.html`
- And all other Volvo/Scania category folders

**Total affected:** 2,497 main product pages

## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE

### The Problem: Missing .html Extension in Canonical Tags

**Actual file URL:**
```
https://partstrading.com/volvo/engine/1522259.html
```

**Canonical tag was pointing to:**
```html
<link href="https://partstrading.com/volvo/engine/1522259" rel="canonical"/>
```

**Problem:** URL mismatch!
- File exists at: `/volvo/engine/1522259.html`
- Canonical points to: `/volvo/engine/1522259` (no .html)

### Why This Prevented Indexing:

Google saw the canonical tag and thought:
1. "This page says the preferred version is at URL without .html"
2. "But that URL doesn't exist or doesn't match"
3. "I won't index this page because it's pointing to a non-existent canonical"

---

## ✅ SOLUTION APPLIED

```html
<link href="https://partstrading.com/volvo/engine/1522259" rel="canonical"/>

```

**After:**
```html
