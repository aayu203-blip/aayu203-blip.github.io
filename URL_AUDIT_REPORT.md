## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES SUMMARY

### Issue #1: Multiple URL Formats Exist
```
Format 1 (CORRECT):  /pages/products/scania/hydraulic-systems-&-connectors/302624.html
Format 2 (WRONG):    /scania/hydraulic/302624
Format 3 (WRONG):    /categories/steering-and-suspension-parts.html
Format 4 (WRONG):    /volvo-categories.html (for a Scania part!)
```

### Issue #2: Wrong Product Information
- Product is labeled as "Rubber Spring" in schema but "Elbow Union" in content
- Product shows "Volvo" in breadcrumbs but is actually "Scania"
- Category mismatch: Schema says "Steering & Suspension" but content says "Hydraulic Systems"

### Issue #3: Relative vs Absolute Paths
- Breadcrumbs use relative paths `../../index.html`
- Makes URLs break when file structure changes
- Not SEO-friendly
