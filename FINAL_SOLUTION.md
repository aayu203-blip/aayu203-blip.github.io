# üéØ FINAL SOLUTION - Make Everything Work

## CURRENT PROBLEMS:

1. ‚úÖ Category page filters - FIXED (removed restrictive filters)
2. ‚úÖ Brand page links - FIXED (now absolute paths)
3. ‚ùå Clean URLs causing redirects - NEEDS FIX

## THE REDIRECT ISSUE:

The clean URLs (/scania/hydraulics/302624) don't match actual files because:
- Vercel rewrites have edge cases
- Folder structure has variations
- Some paths don't match the rewrite rules

## SOLUTION: Use ACTUAL file paths (most reliable)

Instead of clean URLs, use the real file structure that's guaranteed to work:
`/pages/products/volvo/engine-components/12345.html`

This means reverting URLs to match actual files.

OR

## ALTERNATIVE: Keep clean URLs but add _redirects file

Create a `_redirects` file for better URL handling (Vercel supports this).

## RECOMMENDATION:

Let's use ACTUAL file paths for now. They're:
- ‚úÖ Guaranteed to work
- ‚úÖ No Vercel config needed
- ‚úÖ No redirect issues
- ‚úÖ Already indexed by Google

We can add clean URLs as a future enhancement with proper testing.
